# foc_libraries

Incomplete, experimental, almost self-contained single-header libraries.

You will probably be better off using Facebook's
[Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) or Google's
[Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).

## Utilities

 * `foc/support.h`: portable macros for compiler features (e.g.
   `FOC_ATTRIBUTE_ALWAYS_INLINE`) and some other small utilities (e.g.
   `align_addr`).

 * `foc/allocator.h`: contains `MallocAllocator` which is a class you can pass
   as a template parameter to some types.

 * `foc/debugger.h`: utilites to detect if the binary is being debugged and
   running a break instruction. Used by the `foc/loggin.h` library.

## Libraries

 * `foc/logging.h`: logging utilities from Chromium's `base` library.
   Contains macros like `CHECK()`, `DCHECK()`, `DLOG()` and many others.

 * `foc/small_vector.h`: `SmallVector` class based on [LLVM's SmallVector
implementation](https://llvm.org/doxygen/SmallVector_8h_source.html<Paste>).
[Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly) has a [similar class called
`folly::small_vector`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/small_vector.h).
On [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) it goes by the name of
[`abseil::InlinedVector`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/container/inlined_vector.h).

 * `foc/hash_array_mapped_trie.h`: An implementation of [Phil
Bagwell](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/rip-phil-bagwell)'s [Hash Array Mapped
Trie](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/64398).
